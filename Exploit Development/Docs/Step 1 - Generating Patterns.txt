## use a fuzzing loop to determine a size where the application crashes
## in this example we know at least 1000 bytes will crash application
msf-pattern_create -l 1000

## Provided you have the application and a debugger, Reproduction of the crash 
## should be trivial. Then you can query the value of EIP to msf-pattern_offset
msf-pattern_offset -l 1000 -q 35724134
